            🐾 This is Critter Cafe! Your one-stop pet shop for storing and sharing your yummiest recipes!<br><br>
            Write down your recipes for others to view and give feedback on others' post!<br><br>
            This cafe was made by five talented developers at Purdue University—in just a few months!<br><br>
            Who said a bunch of polytechnic nerds couldn't make a website with cute animals?<br><br>
            (Absolutely no one doubted us...but every good story needs conflict)<br><br>
            Website developed by Maaz Zubair, Jae Reynolds, Madison Miles, Katelyn Schein, Jayden Wijeyakulasuriya, and Effie Wang<br><br>
            Have fun navigating the cafe, and don't forget to <a href="#pet">pet the cat!</a> 🐱
